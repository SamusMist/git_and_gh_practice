## My Hobbies

* In the summer I like to go on short hikes with my pup, hit a patio for a beer(if its not 95 degrees), I also enjoy skateboarding, golfing, frisbee golfing, and love to grill tasty food at night when it's not 95 degrees as previously mentioned.

* All other seasons I love to snowboard, play RPG's, see live music, and loom weave
