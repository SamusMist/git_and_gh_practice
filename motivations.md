## Motivations

* This is a very deep subject for me, but in short my physical health is the biggest motivation for switching careers. I have a lot of friends and support in the IT industry to help me along the way, but 10 hour days in an auto shop, dust and fumes, and a major medical incident led me to change careers to something fulfilling which I can enjoy and also keep my body in good shape.
